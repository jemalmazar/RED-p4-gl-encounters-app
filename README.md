# RED Academy Project 4 - GL Encounters App

View the deployed web application at: https://gl-encounters.firebaseapp.com/ (_currently buggy_)

**Project Description**

 A single-page application where the users enter information about themselves and their encounters with aliens.  

**Tools & Methods Used**

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- Ajax
- Gulp, Bower, Sass
- Git & GiHub for version control
- an Angular Project [Seed](https://github.com/redacademy/angular-project/tree/seed)

**Little Things I Learned**

- use case for the _text-indent_ property on forms
- use case for the _resize_ property on textarea elements
- use case for the _.ClassName &_ selector to select that class along with its parent

**Project Epilogue**

 The AngularJS framework was my second foray into manipulating web pages via the MVC. The most important thing I took away from this project was the ability to use Angular directives to manipulate and display data onto the DOM. I had used Ajax to get info from an API before, but using Ajax to post onto an API was a new to me. Learning that making an Ajax post requires a specific _'promise'_ (data) for the post to be accepted was an interesting challenge.

 I had used CSS animations sparsely in my previous projects, so implementing them to animate buttons, forms, and page transitions was a time consuming endeavor. The latter was especially tricky to wrap my head around due to how the way _ng-active_, _ng-leave_, and their active states work with multiple pages.

 Overall, this project was a great introduction to building single-page applications using the AngularJS framework. I enjoy the fact that Angular gives developers lots of tools to make building applications quick and easy.
